      "message": "I think it works this way because for any larger repo, it\u0027s going to be a lot more efficient to rename a repo on the remote than it will be to delete and recreate the repo. While it might be simpler to use replication to create/delete (and I agree with a lot of your points below), I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the correct design.\n\nIf we really want better sharing, I think we\u0027d need to go the route of teaching replication about project renames (either by adding a new event type to core or doing some linking of rename-project and replication-api plugin/module).",
